**OROBORUS** is a small Next.js application. The goal of this project is to explore 
the new features of Next.js 13, focusing on the use of [app dir](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/appDir) 
and the implementation of [advanced routing patterns](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#advanced-routing-patterns).

### Project status

The app is in its **very early stages of development**. It's likely to crash
and burn at any time, it's not optimized, it's not even an MVP (minimum viable
product) for what it wants to be. It's a work in progress, and you can expect
continued development and fixes, horrible temporary design, and all that fun
stuff we all get through when we are creating a prototype of something.
But it will get better! Pretty things just need time.
